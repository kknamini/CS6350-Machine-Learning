This is a light-weighted machine learning library developed by Kurt Namini for CS6350 - Machine Learning at The University of Utah. Each algorithm is implemented solely for binary classification tasks, they will not work as regressors or multi-class predictors. To use these modules I created you must have the NumPy and SciPy installed since both were utilized in my implementations.
